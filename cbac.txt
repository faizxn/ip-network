------------------Context-Based Access Control 

 Is a firewall for Cisco IOS routers that offers inspect up to layer 7 of the OSI model and can dynamically create rules to allow return traffic. 
It is similar to the reflexive access-list but one of the key differences is that the reflexive ACL only inspects up to layer 4.


# show ip port-map

# ip port-map http port tcp 8080   <!--  we can update the database--!!!

# show ip port-map | i http

>both 80| 8080 will be in table 

80 - system defined 
8080 - user defined

Note: self generated traffic is not inspected.

#ip inspect name mycbac icmp router-traffic    !!< now router will  inspect its self generated traffic !!!    <<CBAC
#ip inspect name mycbac icmp audit-trails on     !!< keep track of each and every activity !!!
