#> Used to protect route from tcp sync flood attack.

We will not run TCP intercept for every service. It can be applicable for like 80. 

 Here > router will act as proxy on behalf of web-server.

# debug ip tcp intercept
# show  tcp intercept connections
# show  tcp intercept statistics

>>>>>>>>>>>>watch mode is mostly used..  Default mode is intercept..

Step: 1.  Identifiy the traffic >> Set a ACL..    	 <!--  ip access-list protect-web permit any host 10.0.0.0 eq 80

# ip tcp intercept mode intercept 
# ip tcp intercept list protect-web
# ip tcp intercept connection-timeout 15    	 <!-- if connection is 15 idle, then connection session will timeout... default is 24hrs. otherwise it will occupy a soket of webserver.
# ip tcp intercept max-incomplete high 50   	 <!-- start dropping the packet if maximum-packet incomplete. Do force it to 40.
# ip tcp intercept max-incomplete low 40
# ip tcp intercept drop-mode random 	 <!- randomly drop the packet.
